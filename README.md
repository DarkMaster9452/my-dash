## 🛠️ Setup & Configuration

To set up the authentication and run this dashboard on your own domain:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Navigate to **APIs & Services → Credentials**.
3. Create an **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** (Web application).
4. Add your domain (e.g., `https://darkmaster9452.github.io` or `http://localhost`) to the **Authorized JavaScript origins**.
5. Copy the generated Client ID.
6. Open `index.html` and replace the `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` constant with your Client ID.
7. Update the `ALLOWED_EMAIL` constant with your Google account email to restrict access manually.

### 🔐 Required Vercel env vars for API protection

The `/api/*` endpoints that expose personal data (gmail, calendar, spotify,
notion, vercel-projects, config) verify a Google ID token server-side before
returning any data. Set these in **Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables**:

- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` — same OAuth 2.0 client ID used by the frontend; used to
  verify the token's `aud` claim.
- `ALLOWED_EMAIL` — the single Google account email allowed to access the
  dashboard.
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (optional) — comma-separated list of additional origins
  permitted by CORS (same-origin is always allowed).

Without these, every protected endpoint will return `401`.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML5 / CSS3 / Vanilla JavaScript**: Lightweight, zero-dependency frontend with custom CSS themes and grid layout.
- **Google Identity Services**: Fast and secure authentication.
- **LocalStorage API**: Persistent state management for daily focus, scratchpad notes, and habits tracking without a backend database.
- **External Data APIs**: Open-Meteo API for weather, Frankfurter API for fiat currency, CoinGecko API for cryptocurrency.
